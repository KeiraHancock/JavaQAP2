# Java QAP2 – Class Design & Testing Assignment
## Author: Keira Hancock

This project contains solutions to three object-oriented programming problems using Java. Each section demonstrates class creation, composition, and aggregation using constructors, accessors, mutators, and test drivers.

##  Contents

###  Problem #1: `MyLine` and `MyPoint` Classes
- **Files:** `MyPoint.java`, `MyLine.java`, `TestMyLine.java`
- **Concepts:** Object composition, getters/setters, distance and gradient calculation
- **Tested in:** `TestMyLine.java`

---

###  Problem #2: `MyRectangle` and `MyPoint` Classes
- **Files:** `MyRectangle.java`, `TestMyRectangle.java`
- **Concepts:** Using two `MyPoint` instances to represent rectangle corners
- **Includes methods:** Width, Height, Area, Perimeter
- **Tested in:** `TestMyRectangle.java`

---

###  Problem #3: `CreditCard`, `Money`, `Person`, and `Address` Classes
- **Files:** `CreditCard.java`, `Money.java`, `Person.java`, `Address.java`, `CreditCardDemo.java`
- **Concepts:** Aggregation, copy constructors, comparison methods, balance/credit tracking
- **Tested in:** `CreditCardDemo.java`

##  Instructions

You are allowed to complete the assessment problems below in whatever way you can but please answer the following questions/points as part of your submission:

1. How many hours did it take you to complete this assessment? (Please keep try to keep track of how many hours you have spent working on each individual part of this assessment as best you can - an estimation is fine; we just want a rough idea.)

[approximately 2 hours per problem.]

2. What online resources you have used? (My lectures, YouTube, Stack overflow etc.)

[class lectures & YouTube.]

3. Did you need to ask any of your friends in solving the problems. (If yes, please mention name of the friend. They must be amongst your class fellows.)

[no.]

4. Did you need to ask questions to any of your instructors? If so, how many questions did you ask (or how many help sessions did you require)?

[no.]

5. Rate (subjectively) the difficulty of each question from your own perspective, and whether you feel confident that you can solve a similar but different problem requiring some of the same techniques in the future now that you’ve completed this one.

[problem 1 5/10, problem 2 6/10, problem 3 5/10. yes i feel confident i could solve similar problems using the same techniques.]
